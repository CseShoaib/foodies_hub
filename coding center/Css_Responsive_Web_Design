Viewport Design----
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
Setting The Viewport-----
You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
<!-- intial-Scale and Viewport should have the same vlaue like =1.0(which is given in the meta tag in boiler plate)  -->
Use position shoauld be realtive.{position : relative;}
<!-- What is a Grid-View? -->
Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into columns:
Building a Responsive Grid-View
code:-  *{
    box-sizing :border-box;
}

Then we make one class for each of the 12 columns, class="col-" and a number defining how many columns the section should span:

CSS:
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}
 All these columns should be floating to the left, and have a padding of 15px:
 [class*="col-"] {
  float: left;
  padding: 15px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
<!-- To stop float = left; Use clear:both to prevent column -->
.row::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

What is a Media Query?
It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true
Example
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

<!-- Typical Device Breakpoints -->
There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target five groups:

Example
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}

Orientation: Portrait / Landscape
landscape--it means that width of screen is larger than height of screen.
